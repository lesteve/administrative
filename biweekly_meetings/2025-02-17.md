### Progress reports

- [name=Jérémie]
    - sample weight debugging
        - For MiniBatchKMeans. Several issues in different parts of the estimator (fit, convergence checking, ...)
        https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30751
        Raises questions regarding the equivalence properties we want.
        - For the statistical test. Spurious pvalue constant to 1
        https://github.com/snath-xoc/sample-weight-audit-nondet/issues/14

- [name=Stefanie]
    - PR [FEA Add metadata routing through predict methods of BaggingClassifier and BaggingRegressor](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30833)
    - fairlearn: PR [DOC add example for using ErrorRate](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1502)
    - reviewed several DOC PRs

- [name=Shruti]
    - Fully back from teaching in Cape Town (put out a good work)
    - Working on expanding sample weight testing to clustering algorithms and using a score based equivalence test: https://github.com/snath-xoc/sample-weight-audit-nondet
    - Implemented fix for spurious 1 values found due to construction of np.random.choice (thank you Jeremie)
    - PR https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30751, need to further discuss issues with scaling of weights, sometimes optimisation problem is not well-defined

- [name=Loïc]
    - Use OpenML download URL from OpenML metadata: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30708
    - Download parquet file from OpenML in example: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30824
    - inputs on [public website analysis](https://views.scientific-python.org/scikit-learn.org) https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/30815 ?
    - WIP GaussianMixture Array API wih Stefanie still ongoing: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30777
    - JupyterLite:
      + issue with polars and parquet file: https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/20876
      + issue with CSV and polars.read_csv https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite/issues/1576
    - sphinx-gallery API doc duplicated links to example:
      https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30822 and
      https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub/pull/1239
    - Github actions for arm64 CI (not using CirrusCI anymore): https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30797
    - joblib triage in preparation of the sprint 26-27 @ Inria Paris
    - mybinder.org may become more stable in the future: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30697#issuecomment-2659881848

    - Working on https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30846

- [name=Antoine]
    - still investigating sample_weight and metadata routing
    - found two issues 30818 and 30817

- [name=Arturo]
    - Experimented a bit with stratify on X: [issue #26821](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/26821)

- [name=Vincent]
    - [skrub] iter on Recipe
