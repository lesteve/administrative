# scikit-learn & co bi-weekly meeting

## 2025-01-20

### Progress reports

- [name=Olivier]
    - `sample_weight` related reviews (still some TODO):
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30155 (merged)
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30644 (merged)
    - Final iteration and merge on `float32` optim for `GaussianMixture`:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30415
        - WIP follow-up PR to optimize memory usage (both peak and number of allocations):
            - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30614
            - Need to see if their is any easy fix to the memory layout problems.
            - Some of the changes involve inplace mutation of private method inputs which is ugly.
    - Reading discussion and [literature related to ROC averaging](https://openreview.net/forum?id=FByH3qL87G) and sampling uncertainty in ROC/PR curve estimation. Context: being able to give feedback on:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29611 (uncertainty induced by CV resampling reflected both by variations in estimated model model and evaluation data)
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25939 (idem)
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/25856 (sampling uncertainty: test set only, fixed model)
    - Opened issues with reproducers on:
        - UX problem with `CalibrationDisplay`:
            - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/30664
            - could also be fixed by displaying sampling uncertainty of the curve estimate by default
        - OpenMP threadpool trashing in HGBT
            - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/30662
    - Investigated circle ci config and its implication on security.

- [name=Arturo]
    - Opened [Issue #30652](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/30652) as a result of bumping the mooc version, but I'm happy to close
    - Organized a contribution sprint resulting in:
        - [TST global_random_seed #30517](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30517)
        - [TST global_random_seed #30518](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30518)
        - [DOC Add pipeline related diagrams #30646](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30646)
    - Reviewed [DOC Link to scikit-learn mooc from the docs #30469](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30469)


- [name=Antoine]
    - [FIX Sample weight in BayesianRidge](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30644) merged
    - investigate sample weight in metaestimators (GridSearch, metadata, ...)

- [name=Loïc]

    - scikit-learn
        - OpenML status still problematic. `main` was spared for a while but is now :x:. Removed CircleCI required checks, ⚠️ caveat for auto-merge ...
        - trying to get back OpenML working inside PRs reusing the cache from `main` => security implications looked at by Olivier :x:
        - use Linux arm64 GitHub workers for wheels merged: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30658 (all the wheels are generated on Github , only `[cd build]` is needed, `[cd build gh]` or `[cd build arm]` are gone)
        - Google results points to 1.5 (or dev) doc
          https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/8958#issuecomment-2601856199.
          Seen recently in website stats and reported by someone today.
        - as advertised last week: I merged scipy-doctest for doctests https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30496
        - a few reviews/merge, for example float32 propagation in GaussianMixture https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30415
        - on triage this week (Tim switched with me)

    - Pyodide/JupyterLite:
        - Pyodide updated to scikit-learn 1.6.1 https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/5342 https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-recipes/pull/65
        - trying to reproduce JupyterLite/Pyodide issue seen by Vincent to no avail

    - joblib:
      - looked at caveats using joblib.Memory in notebooks: https://github.com/joblib/joblib/issues/1498 Happy to discuss that with someone else.
      - CI cleanup https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1645
      - merged codespell setup + CI by yarikoptic https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1628
      - use explicit permissions in Github Actions .yml https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1644

- [name=Stefanie]
    - talk on metadata routing at PyLadies Berlin
    - PR [ENH Add replace_undefined_by param to class_likelihood_ratios](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29288) finally merged
        - blueprint for new strategy with the zero division issues
        - PR [FIX update deprecated param for example using class_likelihood_ratios](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30668)
    - PR [_weighted_percentile supports np.nan values](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29034) moving forwards now
        - review from Christian and added some tests
    - PR [ENH Array API support for confusion_matrix converting to numpy array](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30562)
        - failing tests in the CI (min_versions), when the first thing an array gets into touch is `_convert_to_numpy` instead of `check_array`: should we call check_array() from within convert_to_numpy() to fix this (in contrast to using the helper function that I wrote)?; see [comment](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30562#issuecomment-2586855176)
        - made issue [Documenting return array types](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/30638)
    - some DOC reviews ([30676](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30676), [30319](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30319), [30666](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30666), [30665](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30665), [30564]([30564](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30564)))
