    - Gave a tutorial on probablistic classification at EuroScipy:
        - https://github.com/probabl-ai/calibration-cost-sensitive-learning/
    - Many discussions:
        - numpy 2 dtype
        - dispatch mechanism for networkx / scikit-image https://hackmd.io/@seberg/spatch
    - Sprint on scikit-learn with first time contributor, including:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29751 (sorry for the duplicate PR, I had forgotten about the previous one and did not reread the discussion in entirety)

- [name=Arturo]
    - Some reviews
    - Opened [#29727](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29727) to avoid UserWarning when setting label=None in RocCurveDisplay
    - Iter on [#29611](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29611) to rework the ROC curve example with cross-validation
    - @jdockes have you had a look at my review in [#27631](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27631)?

- [name=Emily]
    - KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source Summit + AI_dev in Hong Kong and post-conference tasks (mostly follow-up conversations). Personally connected with ~50 individuals from 20+ different communities. A few communities/open source projects are  interested in collaborating with scikit-learn 
    - OpenAtom Foundation: Like the Linux Foundation, but based in China. Has many open source project including Huawei’s OpenHarmony and OpenEuler
        - Attending [Open Source Summit Europe in Vienna](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/) (Sept. 16-18), they are wondering if we are going to have any presence. They have one of their VPs going and can set up a chat. 
        - OpenAtom’s own Open Source Congress is going to take place in Beijing around early December. They are interested in inviting us to be keynote and/or give a talk or tutorial.
    - K8USG: Kubernetes and AI-native user group, has multiple chapters across the world. I am personally a long-time participant in the Toronto chapter.
        - I met the founder, and he is interested in having a talk on anything scikit-learn related
    - Linux Foundation AI (LF AI): community dedicated to all AI-related projects in the Linux Foundation
        - The Chinese chapter of this community have bi-weekly calls and is interested in having me introduce scikit-learn (and/or any associated open source projects) during their next meeting (Sept. 11)
    - ByteDance: Chinese TikTok parent company
        - Joint webinars
    - KNative, by Red Hat: a tool to help serverless and event driven applications
        - A maintainer is interested in using KNative to deploy scikit-learn models using KNative. (and train models on K8s clusters using KNative as a management tool). Going to try to build a PoC in the next few weeks
    - Submitting a talk to PyLadies conference (thanks Tamara!) about array API
- [name=Stefanie]
    - just came back from vacation
    - read in [Charles Petzhold: Code. The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://www.amazon.de/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0137909101/ref=sr_1_4?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=1MSYHWZ0LHB3L&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.RURWFMZvYyC9zy5EZiYcVcuBXKQwauXfvlS_vwXo1ZhAiLEZSm_Qltrqx0p954jdYrjv4AApMyQs3g4SaFxTgzMd4DR5Rglfs0iuzDXyGADeA8OpE0MvzYFsfie42B_Hg91wZFYKAi4hQIHjFcGL9ZkGvWLK_OkMu3M068dXOGUdE8znSpLNW8cPsWsi_KNAkfq1o-4uAyjqbsSu50M2QrioyoomJnfAelTS9hB8wzg.pf5lYfvIRUX9_POmxGenpVQLUn829KmBbLWkIReQMXU&dib_tag=se&keywords=code&qid=1725281977&sprefix=code%2Caps%2C118&sr=8-4)
