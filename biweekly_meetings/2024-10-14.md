# scikit-learn & co bi-weekly meeting

## 2024-10-14

### Progress reports

- [name=Olivier]
  - Investigated what would be needed to run tests in parallel
with threads to detect GIL related problems when using the free-threading
version of CPython (`cp313t`).
      - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/30007
      - Fixed a problem related to thread-local fixtures
          - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30038
      - Some state leak via estimator instances in parametrized tests.
          - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30039
          - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29584
      - Still many failures related to fixtures that are fundamentally not thread-safe (capsys, monkeypatch) and some that could `tmpdir`.
      - Failures caused by testing warnings
      - Detected some real crashes and freezes (would need to investigate).
  - Some reviews (`_weighted_percentile`, `sample_weight` in k-bins discretizer, linear regression...)

- [name=Jérémie]
    - maintenance: removing deprecated stuff
    - follow-up on sample weight PRs. In particular for the KBinsDiscretizer https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29907.
        - starting from random data and random weights for the statistical test may not be enough to figure out what's the right way to handle sw. Handcrafting a edge case dataset can make it easier.
    - Experimenting with color quantization to rework the KbinsDiscretizer example and replace the KMeans one.
        - The best compression factor we can hope for is 3. Further compression beyond sklearn can increase that.
        - The dtypes we use doesn't make it easy so we have large intermediate steps :(

- [name=Antoine]
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29818 to test sample weight has been merged
    - draft PR to fix LinearRegression sample weight bug
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30040

- [name=Adrin]
    - Triage week
    - back from 2 weeks off
    - scratching my head about cirrus failure (https://cirrus-ci.com/task/6163344187457536)
    - `FrozenEstimator` and `Pipeline(..., transform_input=...)` for 1.6
    - will try to give the 360 feedback back to people

- [name=Tamara]
    - work on two biclustering related PRs #29988 and #29980
    - exploring making skops work with scikit-learn 1.6 https://github.com/skops-dev/skops/issues/443
    - preparing a custom estimators talk (PyLadies)
    - fairlearn PR still needs review https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1410

- [name=Guillaume]
    - Triage week last week
        - Mainly provided feedback on issues + PRs
    - Discuss with Loic about changelog

- [name=Loïc]
    - Using towncrier for changelog management. PR with proof of concept: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30046. Feed-back more than welcome! Switching strategy needs some thought/discussion.
    - free-threaded testing
    - CUDA CI label setting fix (merged): https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30067

- [name=Stefanie]
    - continued with [PR _weighted_percentile supports np.nan values](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29034)
    - Pénélope was in Berlin for the beta-testing of the certification exams
    - Fluent Python: chapter on decorators and closures

### Discussion points

- using links in this document (Stefanie)
- (Adrin) can randomisation be disabled for specific tests?
- (Olivier) k-means compression: ok to use int8 at the end.
- (Adrin) the folder structure doesn't seem that clean, wonder what others think. https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30046/files
- (Adrin) free threaded + tests: classes instead of instances in most cases maybe, with `_construct_instance`?
