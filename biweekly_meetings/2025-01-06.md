## 2025-01-06

### Progress reports

- [name=Stefanie]
    - PR [ENH Array API support for confusion_matrix converting to numpy array](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30562)
        - fixed problem with nullable pandas dtypes for pandas==1.1.5 	(function mapping these to numpy dtypes)
        - fixed tests when pandas is not installed (some CIs had failed)
        - can be reviewed
    - exercises from ISL on linear regression and on manipulating summations
    - Olivier showed me profiling with py-spy; tried it out
    - waiting for reviews:
        - PR [MNT _weighted_percentile supports np.nan values](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29034)
            - and connected PR [ENH Add support for np.nan values in SplineTransformer](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28043)
        - PR [ENH Add replace_undefined_by param to class_likelihood_ratios](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29288)
        - PR [DOC readability and clarity on permutation_test_score in userguide and example](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30351)

- [name=Olivier]
    - DOC improvement on `sample_weight` in glossary:
        - as discussed in the review of [#29907](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29907) that now waits for a second review
        - new PR: [#30564](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30564)
        - Christian plans to review it but we would still need a second reviewer.
        - Did a bit of literature / code review on related topics of causal inference and survival analysis to get a deeper understanding on where weights are actually needed (e.g. AFT in scikit-survival uses IPCW while it's not the case in xgboost).
    - DOC improvement on stratification in cross-validation:
        - [#30576](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30576)
        - ready to review.
    - Another review pass over the Brier score multiclass PR:
        - [#22046](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22046)
        - LGTM but also needs extra reviewer(s)
    - Triage week this week.

- [name=Jérémie]
    - Turn all warnings into errors in the CI PR is ready for review https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29516
    - Reviewed doctest releated PRs and opened https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30575 to make scorers return a python float instead of numpy scalar because of their repr.
    - Last reviews for 1.6.1; mostly tags related PRs.
      I'm waiting for the lockfiles and will create the 1.6.1 release PR

- [name=Antoine]
    - continue multiclass brier score https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22046
    - review Fix linear SVC handling sample weights under class_weight="balanced" https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30057
    - review Add the C-index with IPCW https://github.com/soda-inria/hazardous/pull/71

- [name=Guillaume]
    - Mainly looking at some blockers 1.6.1

- [name=Gael]
    - Some HR
    - Some skore


- [name=Loïc]
   - scikit-learn
     - before the holidays Security report in scikit-learn github linting comment action, see
       https://discord.com/channels/731163543038197871/731509564477800519/1319209181819179048.
       Are we happy enough right now?
     - involved in PyPI meaning of life and github dependents, joblib has more
        downloads than scikit-learn
     - before the holidays: scipy 1.15rc report by scikit-lego lead to scipy fix and unxfail one test https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30515
     - scipy doctest for more robust doctests (used by numpy and scipy): https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30496. This would allow plenty of first good issue PRs
     - doctest tweak to make it less brittle (GradientBoosting with scipy 1.15)
       https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30583

   - joblib
     - a bit of maintenance + light triaging
     - joblib-security@scikit-learn.org. Do we want to use Github builtin security report
       thing? Even for scikit-learn. I think the security report is N/A.
       https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1638
     - restoring codecov coverage: https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1641

   - scikit-learn MOOC
     - use Github actions for PR preview (security notification by
       dependabot) https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/795


### Discussion points

- discussion: security and Tidelift ? Why don't we point more to Tidelift like numpy, scipy, pandas, etc ... could we use it for Huntr? As the person having a look at security reports recently, I would be very happy having a first filtering before we get involved ...
- - https://opencollective.com/scikit-learn/transactions shows the payments we receive from tidelift.
