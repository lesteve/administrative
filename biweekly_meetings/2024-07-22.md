## July 22nd, 2024 3pm CET, 9am ET

### Progress reports

- [name=Lo√Øc]

    - spin is available on `main`, please give it a spin ü•Å https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29012:
        - `spin` shows you a nice menu when you don't remember what you can do
        - `spin install -v`
        - `spin docs --no-plot`
        - `spin test` (you can still use `pytest` if you want)
        - improve spin error message for `spin docs` when not built: https://github.com/scientific-python/spin/pull/224
        - make `spin install` verbose by default: https://github.com/scientific-python/spin/pull/225
    - reviewed and contributed test to `mean_absolute_percentage_error` array API fix for doc-min-dependencies https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29490
    - add pandas and polars to our min dependency build (one more reviewer?): https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29502
    - update lock-file as a comment, ongoing PR by Charlie-XIAO: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29505
    - run scipy tests as part of Pyodide CI https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/4935 instead of my own repo: https://github.com/lesteve/scipy-tests-pyodide

- [name=Shruti]
    - Waiting for review on Logistic Regression CV weighting (pull request #29419)
    - Testing sag and saga optimisers in Logistic Regression CV
    - Working on test sample weighting in bin selection for HistGradientBoosting tree
    - Reading up on proper scoring for concordance metric in survival analysis

- [name=Tamara]
  - fixing (all) the failing estimator checks for fairlearn's estimators, which includes a lot of refactoring and reading scikit-learn code
  - proposed to add `only_non_negative` as an option to `check_array` https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29540

- [name=Emily]
    - PRs ready for review: [mean_poisson_deviance](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29227), [paired_euclidean_distances](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29389)
    - (Accidentally closed mean_poisson_deviance while solving conflict, now it has a codecov error)
    - Going through Stefanie's review comments on weighted percentile (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29431)
    - Interesting issues I found in the backlog and would like to take a look: [MIN_CAT_SUPPORT in HGBT](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19008), [Improve near constant feature detection in scalars](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19898)

- [name=J√©r√©mie]
    - Several clean-up PRs in the tests (all merged). The end goal is to be able to turn all warnings into errors in the CI.
        - wip https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29516
    - Rework of the maintainers page ready for a second review https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29412
    - Quick fix to include license file in wheels https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29522. Do we need/want to make a 1.5.1.post1 ?
    - triage duty this week

- [name=Arturo]
    - Thresholds in DET curve [#29151](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29151) and quantile loss in HGBT regression [#29063](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29063) still waiting for review
    - Function to cross- validate coverage fraction [#29499](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29499)
    - some reviews

- [name=Stefanie]
    - continue reviewing [FIX min_value and max_value not indexed when features are removed](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29451#) in IterativeImputer
    - knowledge exchange with Emily and Loic on CI and Array API
    - PR [ENH Array API for check_consistent_length](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29519)
    - reviewing PR [Add array API support for _weighted_percentile](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29431#)
    - continue linear algebra course; lots of gaussian elimination

- [name=Tim]
    - worked on GPU CI
    - reviewing array API PRs
    - "random things"

- [name=Jerome]
    - add skrub [TableReport](https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub/pull/984)
    - POC [online demo](https://jeromedockes.github.io/skrub-online-reports/)
    - reviewed misc small improvements to docs

- [name=Adrin]
    - Did triage (but still catching up since didn't have much time)
    - `linalg.eigh` returning (small) negative values [#29534](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/29534)

- [name=Guillaume]
    - Just back from vacation and catching up with my mail box

### Discussion points
- [name=Adrin] `quicksort` (stable) vs `mergesort`
    - ask why the user cares, and close them all if it's not valid
- [name=Adrin] closed a bunch of AI generated looking issues
    - PRs are slightly more welcome than just issues
- [name=J√©r√©mie] do a 1.5.1post1 to add COPYING file to wheels?
    - will be fixed in future releases
- [name=Adrin] array API is breaking existing code where array API is not enabled, since we don't have a good coverage
    - we have had tests that do not use array API anywhere break as the result of array API changes.
    - this breakage goes unnoticed because we, for example, don't build all documentation examples
    - not a great look if we keep introducing regressions while adding array API support
    - potential fix: add a unittest that explicitly exercises the feature/use-case that leads to breakage that we discover "by chance"
        - for example a test in the array API test suite that uses polars as input to make sure polars + no array API works
- [name=J√©r√©mie] negative eigen values
