        - https://gist.github.com/ogrisel/af21bdc55a2c02671a48c68631ee7294
    - Reviewed/contributed a bit to the 1.6.0 release highlights
    - Reviewing active array API PRs
    - Some feedback on multiclass Brier loss / KBinsDiscretizer `sample_weight`
    - Will be off from Thursday 12th to the 20th of December

- [name=Antoine]
    - Fix the input_tags.sparse flag
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30187
    soon ready for second review
    - continue multiclass brier score
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22046

- [name=Jérémie]
    - Release 1.6.0 final
        - issue with test pypi. 1.6.0 is there and manually downloading and install a wheel works but `pip install scikit-learn==1.6.0` fails because pip can't find 1.6.0
        I believe it's a test pypi issue but I'd like to be sure before pushing the tag.

- [name=Arturo]
    - [FIX Avoid UserWarning when setting label=None in RocCurveDisplay](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29727)
    - Looking for good first issues to organize a sprint next week

### Discussion points
- [name=Adrin] I've used nuSVC a lot more than the C-regularized SVMs. The parameter is more intuitive.
- [name=Adrin] re:float32 It sounds odd to intentionally reduce precision on existing code.
- [name=Adrin] re:stratification I cannot remember a business case where the decision would be based on the variance of the performance. This seems to be sth which people in academia would care about. Also, does the uncertainty stay if we repeat the cv experiment many times and then compare the two cases. "What it's supposed to measuer" depends on whom you ask.
- [name=Olivier] pip install from testpypi
    - [name=Jérémie] it just started working Oo !!
- [name=Arturo] Would it make sense to have realistic examples on when to use `sample_weights`?
    - survival analysis
    - causal-effect estimation
    - fairness violation
    - time-based distribution shift
- [name=Olivier] hazardous
