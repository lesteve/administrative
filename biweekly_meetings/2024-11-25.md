### Progress reports

- [name=Guillaume]
    - triage week
    - work on backward compatibility with tags
    - follow-up with Lucy on some visualization PRs
        - need second review: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29797
    - Debugging session with Loic
        - missing values in ExtraTrees
        - CircleCI failures
    - call with NumFOCUS related to kick-off of CZI grant

- [name=Olivier]
    - BIC based model selection for GMMs:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/30323
    - Follow-up on https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30256
    - Tried to debug jupyterlite related problems for the probabl certification.

- [name=Loïc]
    - Fix in ExtraTreeRegressor missing data handling (merged): https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30318 (seen in free-threaded CI)
    - OpenBLAS 0.3.28 bug https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/issues/4981 was already fixed in dev version. Original bug is https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/30151 segmentation fault when using `threadpool_limits` + `joblib` + `pairwise_distances`. What do we want to do? Should we encourage numpy and scipy to ship wheels with 0.3.27, ask OpenBLAS for a 0.3.29, do nothing?
    - scipy bug seen in free-threaded is highly likely the same OpenBLAS bug in 0.3.28 https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/21479
    - Switch to using conda lock file for free-threaded CI build: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30312
    - CircleCI fix due to `ninja` not aware of cgroups v2 https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30333
    - free-threaded wheels for Windows (merged): https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30313

- [name=Stefanie]
    - continued work on PR [ENH Add replace_undefined_by param to class_likelihood_ratios](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29288)
    - some statistical learning on model evaluation
    - read Fluent Python chapter on inheritance
    - still awaiting review on PR [MNT _weighted_percentile supports np.nan values](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29034)

- [name=Antoine]
    - [Check sample weight equivalence on sparse data](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30137) merged
    - working on [multiclass brier score](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22046)
    - review [DOC attempt to fix lorenz_curve in plot tweedie regression example](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30198)


### Discussion points

- [name=Guillaume] should we schedule a developer sprint for scikit-learn next year?
    - I'll send an email to the mailing list to mention that we want to organize a meeting in June. I'll ask preference for which week and who would require travel sponsorship.
- [name=Loïc] is it worth me trying to contact Jeremy Tuloup to have an IRL hacking session about JupyterLite issues?
    - https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite/issues/1464
- [name=Olivier] OpenBLAS version for next numpy / scipy releases

 - [name=Guillaume] **Probabl related**: thoughts about an internship through the MSc. MVA
    - Needs to be some kind of related to research.
    - Do we have the bandwidth to supervise?
    - [Adrin]: if it's sth like what we talked about with Tamara, seems useful
    - [Olivier]: `CalibratedRegressorCV` in particular for Quantile regressor.

- [name=Adrin]
    - latex in docstrings: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30322
        - use `r"` and use latex and remove ascii version / move it to code
    - Add reflection to reduce bias near boundary for KernelDensity: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29370
    - rather merge this one (metrics guidelines): https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/11430

- [name=Loïc] scikit-learn security report in Huntr. My feeling is that it's probably not an issue in scikit-learn per se, but a second opinion would be nice
