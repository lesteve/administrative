# scikit-learn & co bi-weekly meeting

## August 5th, 2024 3pm CET, 9am ET

### Progress reports

- [name=Guillaume]
    - Follow-up feedback PRs:
        - Merged PR introducing `ensure_non_negative`
        - Feedback on some SLEP006 related PRs

- [name=Olivier]
    - Triaging week:
        - Investigating Bus error on macOS leading to a [TerminatedWorkerError](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/29579)
            - Used `PYTHONFAULTHANDLER=1` to se that it happens with numpy 2.0.1 in a call to `sort`
            - PR to loky to enable this automatically on workers:
                - https://github.com/joblib/loky/pull/419
            - Seems related to bus errors in numpy 2.0.1 `_unique1d` when building wheels for macOS:
                - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/29610
                - Not related to joblib/loky: can happen in any test that callses `type_of_target`.
                - Impossible to reproduce locally on Apple M1 so far... (I tried many things)
        - Use of threading vs loky in `pairwise_kernel` / `pairwise_distance`:
            - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/29587
            - OP reported benchmarks:
                - sometimes threading is better, sometimes loky is (much) better
                - tested with CPython 3.13 with free-threading enabled: threading is always better whenever we disable nested parallelism in BLAS
                - TODO: un-hardcode backend and call joblib with soft backend hinting instead (`prefer="threads"`).
        - A bit of triaging on `cloudpickle` + a fix for CPython 3.13 support that was broken (+ updated CI):
            - https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/534
        - Started to investigate problems with dependencies between tests with scikit-learn:
            - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29584
            - Need to finish.
    - TODO: work on EuroScipy tutorial

- [name=Emily]
    - [doctest to be compatible wirh numpy >= 2](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29613) ready for review
    - [_weighted_percentile pytest error](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29431/files#r1684254888)
    - Starting to work on Nystroem. Will test performance on CPU vs GPU once finished (also for rbf kernel)
    - Worked on reproducing meson=1.5 error on Mac with intel chip

- [name=Tim]
    - more GPU CI tweaks
    - small amount of review/feedback on array API PRs

- [name=Stefanie]
    - started to prepare talk on metadata routing for PyData Paris
    - PR [ENH Array API for check_consistent_length](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29519)
    - draft PR [MNT Parallel build of sphinx_gallery](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29614)
    - PR [FIX array api support for clip param of MinMaxScaler](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29615)
    - linear algebra course

### Discussion points

- [name=Adrin] is running the CI locally never reproducing it?
    - what test/code to run locally to try and reproduce the bus error?
    - [name=Guillaume] ARM64 vs. Intel processors?

- [name=Olivier] examples of use of `sample_weight`:
    - adjusting a Poisson loss function for number of incidents based on observation duration (see insurance example in gallery)
        - [example link](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_poisson_regression_non_normal_loss.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-linear-model-plot-poisson-regression-non-normal-loss-py)
    - adjusting a classification loss function for censoring in a survival analysis setting
    - adjusting an causal effect estimator to work on observation data by modeling "propensity scores".
        - [Example of IPTW](https://florianwilhelm.info/2017/04/causal_inference_propensity_score/)

- [name=Olivier] time command in linux / macOS to measure build duration
    - [name=Adrin] `time` or `/bin/time` kinda thing (shell's `time` is different from an executable provided by the package providing it)
    - [name=Adrin] you could also do `command1 && echo -en "\007"` to literally do a beep after `command1` is finished :grin:

- [name=Stefanie] debug cupy related errors using Colab
    - [name=Adrin] python's `%pdb` might be helpful: https://realpython.com/python-debugging-pdb/
