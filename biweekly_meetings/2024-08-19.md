### Progress reports

- [name=Olivier]
    - Working on a tutorial on calibration and cost-sensitive learning (intro slides) with Guillaume for EuroScipy
        - [Intro slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EW3alaVuUKzk8aCWONxpBQQ1LqCmFHNixIwbnfgjuSA/edit?usp=sharing)
    - Some follow-up and reviews on array API and sample weights PRs.
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29475 ready for second review and needed for Emily's PR for Nystroem.

- [name=Tamara]
    - Working on making fairlean's estimators more scikit-learn compatible
         - Refactoring as a consequence and rethinking estimator testing: https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1399#discussion_r1716676515
         - Pausing another branch with fixes until the testing is revised

- [name=Adrin]
    - Was on Triage
    - performance regression due to compiler flags with TSNE
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/29665
    - working on [estimator flags](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29677)
        - and `_validate_data`: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29672


- [name=Guillaume]
    - Preparing presentation for stay in Mathis Lab in Geneva
        - Quick overview on scikit-learn
        - Mini-sprint on Friday
    - Preparing the EuroSciPy tutorials
        - https://github.com/probabl-ai/calibration-cost-sensitive-learning
        - `pixi` + JupyterBook
        - JupyterLite: https://github.com/glemaitre/calibration-cost-sensitive-learning-jupyterlite (temporary)

- [name=Lo√Øc]
    - back from holiday
    - preparing EuroScipy talk on CPython 3.13 free-threaded
    - on triage this week


- [name=Arturo]
    - Not much (mostly focused on probabl stuff)


### Discussion points

- compiler flags: which one?
    - Probably `-O2` by default and specific `-O3` on specific modules but we need to check. Loic tried to replicate module specific configs from setuptools to the corresponding module specific meson files.
    - issue related to debug mode with meson: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/29650
    - comment showing how to get the actual compiler command with meson https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28603#issuecomment-2249637656
- scikit-learn version on pyodide:
    - https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/5014
        - easy to do similarly to https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/4823
    - Use pyodide dev inside JupyterLite: https://github.com/lesteve/jupyterlite-pyodide-dev
    - scikit-image upgrade where we should follow the discussion regarding a release candidate: https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/5003
- GOV reminder email for emeritus:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29691
