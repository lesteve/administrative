# scikit-learn & co bi-weekly meeting

## July 8th, 2024 3pm CET, 9am ET

### Progress reports

- [name=Adrin]
    - reviews on SLEP6 and a look at some array API work
    - Adam accepted to be a maintainer!
    - less time on sklearn, but will keep working with Stefanie (when needed) and Tamara
    - released skops=0.10.0 with numpy2 support (was rather painful)
    - need to release fairlearn with all the fixes Tamara has made

- [name=Olivier]
    - Investigated a `[scipy-dev]` regression detected by our CI. Temporary workaround:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29432
    - hazardous sprint:
        - discussions on how to properly generalize the Concordance Index survival analysis metric to the competing risks setting
        - worked on the integration to the variant of the main estimator described in Julie Alberge's manuscript:
            - https://github.com/soda-inria/hazardous/pull/53
            - This is multi-indicidence variant (with builtin softmax normalization) of our previous one-risk-vs-others estimator.
        - Various PR reviews (improvements in docstrings, API fixes to use consistent shapes in returned arrays, documentation improvements...)
        - Still WIP:
            - more PRs to review
            - would like refactor the competing risks IPCW estimation to use a generic wrapper for any survival analysis estimator
    - Reviewed and discuss Shruti's progress in fixing sample_weight support in linear models with internal CV:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29308 (ElasticNetCV)
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29419 (LogisticRegressionCV)
    - Trying to catch-up on array API and other reviews.
    - Addressed first review on `fetch_file`:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29354
        - Need to address the second review.
    - FYI:
        - I will be off for 2 weeks starting next Friday (included)
        - Need to find a replacement for triaging
        - Need to organize travel to EuroScipy 2024

- [name=Jérémie]
    - Released 1.5.1
    - follow-up experimenting OpenBLAS callback mechanism
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29403

- [name=Stefanie]
    - discussing Array API on `_weighted_percentile` with Emily

    - conversation about ch. 03 Fluent Python (sets and dicts)
    - continue learning linear algebra
        - good recource which starts with patterns and finishes with definitions: https://www.lem.ma/library

- [name=Loïc]
    - on triage last week, busy answering issues, fixing CI, small PR reviews
    - Fix issues when updating main-ci lock-files: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29388
    - Check build dependency version in meson.build (relying on `pyproject.toml` has limitations). Had a closer look at cross-compilation edge case and I think it should be fine: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28721
    - Remove support for setuptools build: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29400
    - `make clean` if you notice weird compilation issue (for example switching between Numpy<2 and Numpy>=2 in same environment): https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29413
    - `/take` workflow was broken for 6 months. Fixed but do we think this is useful? https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29408
    - meson-python quality of life improvement: add obvious error when rebuilding fails https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python/pull/648
    - meson-python Pytest assertion rewriting bug: https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python/issues/646

- [name=Shruti]
    - Working on pull request #29308 for fix_elastic_net_cv adding in test
    - working on Logistic RegressionCV pull request and integrating test into existing tests for sample weights #29419
    - Uploaded common tests to gist for sample_weight handing in regressors and classifiers: indentified problematic regressors and classifiers (e.g., elasticnet and lasso cv, logisticregressorcv, histgradientboostingtrees)

### Discussion points


- [name=Olivier] About [GP ConvergenceWarning](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29380): did you try to create a local environment using the CI lock file to reproduce?
    - -Werror::ConvergenceWarning might give better insight into things.

- [name=Olivier] Taking over other people's pull requests.

- [name=Loïc] Update scikit-learn calendar when triaging changes: worth it or not?
    - [name=Adrin] Just did, forgot to do that. Definitely worth it. Also added an email notification for everyone, and made everyone able to edit the "event" to tune the notification to something else or none if they wish.

- [name=Loïc] quick opinion check `/take` workflow do we think it's useful?

- [name=Adrin] are we reusing the PR about sample_weight from way back?
