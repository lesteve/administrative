# scikit-learn & co bi-weekly meeting

## 2024-10-28

### Progress reports
- [name=Shruti]
    - Working on PR for KBinsDiscretizer https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29907
    - Working on PR for LinearSVC compute_class_Weights https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30057
    - Reviewing TProcessRegressor and doing testing (with Rosenbrock and Camel Hump functions): https://gist.github.com/snath-xoc/1e609ac98c2c3636fa5a1a9c52ed5c6b

- [name=Olivier]
    - revived a PR on improving linear model tests:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25948
        - still WIP
    - `sample_weight` fixes:
        - more sensitive common check:
            - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30143
            - not sure if some of the newly discovered failures are numerical convergence problems or real bugs
        - reviews (resample, kbinsdiscretizer, linear regression...)
    - CI investigations, a bit of array API follow-up and a bit of developer API brainstorming

- [name=Guillaume]
    - Vacation time
    - Reviewing H-statistics PR: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28375
    - Introducing a new parameter into the partial-dependence computation: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30111
    - TODO:
        - Start preparing the release candidate for next week
        - Going to review the items from the milestones
        - Need to finalize the scikit-learn priorities

- [name=Emily]
    - My studies took over life for a month so not too much has happened
    - I realized that the `_weight_percentile` thing is a downstream dependency for many things that contributors are trying to work on, so I have been working on that. Going to do a push later today
    - CFP for PyLadies Con was accepted, it was about Array API. I need to start working on that and would really appreciate any help/input ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰


- [name=Antoine]
    - PR on fixing the [LinearRegression sample weight bug](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30040) has been merged
    - during this PR we realized that:
        - we also need a [sample weight consistency test on sparse data](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30137)
        - we need to fix the [sparse array case for LinearRegression](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/30131)

- [name=Stefanie]
    - continued with [PR _weighted_percentile supports np.nan values](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/29034)
    - started reading Introduction to Statistical Learning with Tamara
    - reading Fluent Python chapters 10 and 11

- [name=Adrin]
    - Developer API work
        - `_xfail_checks`: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30149
            - we can now easily check if our marked xfail checks actually fail (some of them don't)
        - `_estimator_type`: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30122
    - sklearn PR reviews, release PR reviews
    - Fairlearn: CI / Keras - TF issues
    - Trying to get a skops release out
    - Scikeras -> Keras scikit-learn wrappers: https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/20399

- [name=LoÃ¯c]
    - pairwise distances segmentation fault with OpenBLAS 0.3.28 https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/30151. Somewhat similar pattern to a free-threaded bug seen in scipy https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/21479
    - a bit of feed-back/discussion on changelog edge cases
    - had another go at running free-threaded tests locally with [pytest-run-parallel](https://github.com/quansight-labs/pytest-run-parallel) and focusing on Python fatal errors for now
    - meson-python version check tweak https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30167

- [name=Tamara]
    - officially a fairlearn maintainer since last week ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
    - fairlearn maintainer meeting resulted with a big community improvement focus for the next two weeks
    - working on fairlearn docs ([1](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/1353), [2](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/issues/1301), [3](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn/pull/870/)) and the ongoing discussion about the "learning objectives"
    - the bigraph scikit-learn PRs are still open
    - looking into extending the inspection package in scikit-learn


### Discussion points

- The original scikit-learn 2011 paper has more than 100k citations on google scholar!
- [name=Olivier] which specific design patterns do you have in mind Stefanie?
    - the Strategy pattern and the Command pattern: how are they used in scikit-learn (also, if methods are replaced by functions would count)
- [name=Tamara] can anyone help with setting up binder with sphinx for fairlearn(that set it up for scikit-learn)?
    - [name=LoÃ¯c] the few last times I tried Binder was not very functional ...
- [name=Olivier] scikeras with pytorch support vs sktorch
