# scikit-learn & co bi-weekly meeting

## 2025-02-03

### Progress reports

- [name=Olivier] & [name=Shruti]
  - Progress on comprehensive deterministic and stochastic estimator  testing for correct use of `sample_weight`:
      - https://github.com/snath-xoc/sample-weight-audit-nondet/blob/main/reports/sklearn_estimators_sample_weight_audit_report.ipynb
      - Still need proper way to test clustering algorithms and simpler handling of transformers
      - Summary:
        ```
        ✅ 19 passed the deterministic test
        ❌ 4 failed the deterministic test
        ✅ 14 passed the statistical test
        ❌ 17 failed the statistical test
        ❌ 5 other errors
        ⚠ 112 lack sample_weight support
        ```
    - Next: plan to give feedback on stratification, array API, display PRs issue/PR:
      - calibration binning / uncertainty https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/30664
    - Will come to Paris soon (Wednesday and Thursday)

- [name=Loïc]
    - will be in Paris Tuesday - Thursday
    - Remove 10 year old tutorial links (1 more approval needed) https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30724
    - Use OpenML dataset description for download URL: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30708
    - metrics always return Python floats Jérémie's PR (merged): https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30575
    - end of the OpenML saga (still using scikit-learn/examples for one parquet file)
    - indexing of older versions doc by search engines was due to switch to sphinx-pydata-theme. It seems to have been fixed by using canonical link (Tim's PRs)? Double-check with your favourite search engine!
    - social media links have been updated
    - gave opinions on scikit-image JupyterLite interactive doc https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/7644 and moving sphinx-gallery JupyterLite functionality to jupyterlite-sphinx https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/issues/1427
    - joblib security reports on Huntr opened by the same person. 3 marked as spam (not by me), replied to the last one
    - joblib sprint @ Inria Paris wed. 26/ thu. 27 February. Started to collect good issues in a [Github project](https://github.com/orgs/joblib/projects/1?query=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aopen), feel free to add some!

- [name=Stefanie]
    - [ENH Array API support for confusion_matrix converting to numpy array](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30562)
        - second suggestion of how to solve pandas extension dtype 	failure
    - some doc reviews
    - [issue](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/150314) at Github about inconsistent search functionality
    - continued with Guillaumes Traces course (trees and bagging)

- [name=Arturo]
    - Helped contributor of [#30740 DOC Add drawings to demonstrate Pipeline, ColumnTransformer, and FeatureUnion](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30740) with her setup
    - [Jupyterlab kernel crash after page refresh](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/16059)

- [name=Antoine]
    - fix sample weight in GridSearch
        - draft PR forward sample weight to the scorer https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30743
        - need to investigate when metadata is enabled
    - reviews hazardous

- [name=Guillaume]
    - mainly work on `skore` library with brainstorming with [name=Adrin]
    - attended FOSDEM


- [name=Vincent]
    [skrub]
    - Released 0.5.1 (adding StringEncoder and fixes for the datasets fetcher)
    - P16 conference in Paris to collect feedback about TableReport, tabular_learner and the recipe
    - Testing the recipe on a few examples, we want to release this thing soon

    [hazardous]
    metrics PRs are moving forward thanks to @Antoine
    - Slight revamp of the C-index metric
    - Enhance the accuracy in time

### Discussion points

- [name=Guillaume] I confirm that Kagi search engine looks to have the same behaviour than Google and point out to 1.6.1

- [name=Loïc] Stefanie's Github search issue: probably an alternative way to do what you want. Likely due to us switching to "new-style issues" (or whatever it is called with sub-issues)

- [name=Loïc] JupyterLab/JupyterLite issue, do you have a way to reproduce?

- [name=Arturo] JupyterLite crash on the scikit-learn.org/stable examples.
    - error in the JS console of firefox when running the first cell of an example with import statements `TypeError: _query_package() got multiple values for argument 'index_urls'`
