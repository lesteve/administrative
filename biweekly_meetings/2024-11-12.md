    - use the original git-history

- [name=Gael]: comment (no need for discussion): warn the comms team in advance to prepare for the release
- [name=Gael]: comment (no need for discussion):
    - Where we removed the "prefit", did we make sure to point to Frozen in the documentation?
- [name=Guillaume] @GaelVaroquaux what is the quick summary regarding the wheels improvements for specific hardware
- [name=Gael]: PR on weights for MLP (#25646): be kind to original author
- [name=Adrin]: new plugin API by Tim: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/30250
